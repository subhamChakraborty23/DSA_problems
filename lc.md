✨ 🏆 LeetCode 2021 Achievements 🏆 ✨

- I started LeetCode around september 2020 and it has really helped me a lot mainly by helping me develop a daily coding habit which i continued to repeat this year.
- I got my first job in Jio Platforms as an 👨🏻‍💻 SDE , all thanks to LeetCode!
- After that I have been consistently practicing every day but also took some day off and tried to solve as many daily challenges and monthly challenges as possible [received some of the badges but could not get them all and also missed the annual badge by a count of 10 days 😢] 
- I have solved almost 540+ problems till now and hoping to solve more in the future.  
- I have collected DP-1 and DS-1 badges.
- Learned so many concepts from all the problems solved till now and also tried use this knowledge in my work and projects.
- Recently i redeemed my first Leetcode T-shirt 👕 and I am so happy 😁 to have it.
